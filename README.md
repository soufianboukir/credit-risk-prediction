# Credit Risk Prediction System

A complete machine learning pipeline for predicting loan default risk using tabular financial data.  
The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment through a simple Streamlit application.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to classify whether a loan applicant is likely to **default (1)** or **not default (0)** based on financial and personal attributes.

The system includes:
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Multiple ML models training and evaluation
- Model comparison and selection
- Deployment via a Streamlit web app

---

## Dataset

- Total samples: **28,800**
- Features after encoding: **18**
- Train/Test split:
  - Train: 23,040
  - Test: 5,760
- Default rate: ~22%

### Features include:
- Personal: age, income, employment length
- Loan: amount, interest rate, grade, intent
- Credit history: past defaults, history length
- Derived: loan-to-income ratio

---

## Models Trained

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Pipeline

1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Creating loan-to-income ratio
3. Train/Test split
4. Model training
5. Evaluation using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision / Recall
   - F1 Score
   - ROC-AUC
6. Model selection
7. Saving artifacts

---

## Saved Artifacts

- `best_model.pkl` → selected model (Random Forest)
- `scaler.pkl` → feature scaler
- `feature_columns.pkl` → ordered feature list
- `metadata.pkl` → model configuration
- `model_results.csv` → comparison results

---

## Running the App

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run All notebooks inside `notebooks/` folder

### 3. a folder named `/models` will be generated at `/notebooks`, Move it to root directory

### 4. Run this command and copy past the output ip address into your browser

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Usage

- Enter applicant details
- Click "Predict"
- Get:
```
Loan decision (Approved / Denied)
